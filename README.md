# RAGProject
This repository will contain my very first RAG Project. This is a RAG assistant that uses Embeddings from Huggingface and Google Gemini's 'gemini-2.0-flash' model. 
Once a user uploads a PDF document, the RAG Assistant will appear and the user can ask any questions pertaining to that document, and the Assistant will be able to answer. 

This is also deployed at streamlit. Link:
